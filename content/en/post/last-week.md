# My last week

## How I spend my last week

1. The first and I think the most important that I made a lot of laboratory works
2. Thanks to the implementation of point 1 I got a lot of free time and I could to saw some films. One of them was "Inception" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
3. I spend some time to read the books and pass the course in internet.

## My review of the week

I think the week has been quite productive. I did all homework not only for this week, but also for the next week. I got a lot of free time and spend it with benefit for me. I also didn't forget about rest and I watched some films and read some books.
